# TorrentRS

### TorrentRS is a BitTorrent client built in Rust, to explore low-level network programming and the BitTorrent protocol. This project demonstrates the process of creating a basic peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing client, from establishing peer connections to managing file downloads.

### Features

  - Peer Communication: Handshakes, peer discovery, and message exchanges for initiating downloads.
  - Piece Downloading: Requests and receives pieces of the file from multiple peers.
  - Error Handling: Robust error handling for reliable data transfers.
  - Rust Performance: Utilizes Rustâ€™s concurrency and memory safety features for optimal performance.

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/kamalnayan10/torrentrs
cd torrentrs
```

Build the project:
```
cargo build --release
